<bootstrap-panel [body]="body"></bootstrap-panel>
<!--
	One way to set heading and the body is use property binding ([body]="body"), 
	so we can define input properties like heading and body
	and set them to the body property of app component.
	But i dont want to go to our component and define a property called body 
	and there add my markup. I want to do it here.
